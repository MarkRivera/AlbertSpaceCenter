            <h2>A brief synopsis:</h2>
            <p>
                Born in Ulm, Württemberg, Germany in 1879, Albert Einstein had a passion for inquiry that eventually led him to develop the special and general theories of relativity. In 1921, he won the Nobel Prize for physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect and immigrated to the U.S. in the following decade after being targeted by the Nazis. Einstein is generally considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century, with his work also having a major impact on the development of atomic energy. With a focus on unified field theory during his later years, Einstein died on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey.

            <h2>Miracles and Special Relativity:</h2>
            <p>
                In 1905—seen by many as a "miracle year" for the theorist—Einstein had four papers published in the Annalen der Physik, one of the best known physics journals of the era. One of the papers focused on his theory of Special Relativity; which stated that the laws of physics were the same for all non-accelerating observers. The proverbial icing on the cake was that the speed of light in a vaccuum (299,792,458 m/s) was independent of the motion from all observers. In simpler words, light travels the same speed regardless if you were moving faster or standing still.

            <h2>General Relativity:</h2>
            <p>
                The general (pun intended) idea behind general relativity is that space is curved. Mass creates this curve and because of the curvature we experience the sensation of gravity. All things in the universe that have mass, have gravity.
